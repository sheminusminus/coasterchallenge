main working version of all the site files we created!

this is the most updated version, containing both the regular and minified versions for development purposes.
the .html in this folder is only using the expanded files, with the exception of normalize.min.css.

thank you for letting us work with you! please enjoy.

(if you ever have any questions, feel free to email emily, who is putting together this archive and
knows what all the stuff is and/or why its included: emkolardev@gmail.com)
